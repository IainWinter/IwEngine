This is going to be v2 of the framework. Focusing on making it as small and understandable as possible. I have a feeling that each of the libraries from before could just be a single file. Most of the functionality gets included no matter what, so a single file makes it simpler to use. Also, a single file lets you know the level of abstraction as you get deeper into the file as things need to be defined before they can be used. Looking at a folder of many files does not give you this idea at a glance.
